# Dataset
Amazon Customer Reviews is one of the most rich and informational dataset. In a period of over two decades since the first review in 1995, millions of Amazon customers have contributed over a hundred million reviews to express opinions and describe their experiences regarding products on the Amazon.com website which makes it a rich source of information for academic researchers in the field of Information Retrieval (IR) tasks. For this mini project an Amazon Grocery dataset has been chosen.
